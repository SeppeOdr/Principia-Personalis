# The Physics of Building Habits

Our habits. The activities we do on a regular basis. Sometimes, we don’t even notice that we are doing them because they are second nature to us. Though, sometimes, when we get to notice those habits, we want to break them. Other times, we want to build a new habit. Yet, even when we really want to change them, it feels really difﬁcult to do so. It requires a lot of mental energy. However, we can try to learn the principles behind these efforts such that we can develop strategies to help us break and build the habits we want.

## What is the principle behind habits?

Because of my studies and after some testing in my own life, I’m convinced that Newton’s First Law can describe building and breaking habits best. This law of physics states that a body at rest stays at rest and a body in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.

In day-to-day terms this means that if you don’t put in any effort (external force), you won’t be able to change your routine (you are at rest). In contrast, if you decide to actively think about changing your habits and you actually try to take the required action, you will start to ﬁnd it easier to keep taking action (you are exerting an external force). And eventually, when you try it for a long enough time, you will stop thinking about breaking or building the habit. You have changed. The habit is now developed and no extra effort will be needed anymore (you are in motion).

## How does this work in practice?

Just like with moving objects, we have two different options when it comes to habits. We might want to break an old habit (bring it to rest), or we might want to develop a new one (bring it in motion). The force that we need to exert (the action that we need to take) is a bit different for these two situations. Actually, to build a new habit, we need to do almost the opposite from when we want to break one.

### How can we develop a new habit?

Most of the time, developing a new habit is much easier than breaking an old habit; at least according to my experience. Therefore, I want to handle this option ﬁrst. That way, you will already be warmed up a bit for the part on breaking old habits.

For building a new habit, we want to take action such that, eventually, we don’t have to think about it anymore. So, the new habit should start moving in a positive direction. But how can we do that?

First, we need to change our mindset around this new habit. We already need to think and act like if we already were the person that we want to become directly from the start:
- We don’t want to be runners. We are runners who run three times per week.
- We don’t want to be readers. We are readers who read for 30 minutes every day.
This identity shift is the ﬁrst step: it gives your force a direction.Second, it would be really helpful to schedule when you want to do the habit. Preferably, we schedule this habit at a regular time. Also, it will help if we couple the new habit to one that we are already used to. For example, after brushing my teeth at 08:00, I will sit down to meditate for 5 minutes. By being speciﬁc and regular with the timing of the new habit, it will take less effort to remember it and to take action. As an analogy, to move a heavy box, it’s easier to ﬁrst put it on wheels. This removes the friction, hence there will be less force required to move the box.

### How can we break an old habit?
For breaking an old habit, we want to take action against the habit, such that it essentially slows down until we completely stop doing the habit. Luckily, there also are some strategies to stop doing those.

One strategy is to do something else instead of validating the old habit. By this, I mean that as we start thinking about doing the old habit, we need to stop for a second. Just close your eyes and start breathing deeply and slowly for a moment. This short breathing exercise will give us some time to decide to do some other thing. This will cause more friction which will make the habit more difﬁcult to keep. This other thing could be a short walk around your neighborhood or even doing a quick workout. These kinds of activities act as opposing forces to the habits we want to break. So, this short walk or workout (or some other activity), will help us in such a way that we won’t be thinking of that activity that we want to stop doing. The more times you repeat such a short break when thinking about this habit, the more friction and the more of the opposing force this old habit will experience, and the more you will train your brain to be more mindful of what you actually want or need to do.
