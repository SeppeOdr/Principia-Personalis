title: Why a Physics Student is Writing about Self-Improvement
---
Hi,

I'm Seppe. As a physics and astronomy student, I've already spent a few years studying the fundamental laws of the universe. And I've realized that these laws don’t just govern planets and stars; they govern us. This realization made me dive deeper into how exactly these laws apply to our lives by trying to put them into practice in my own daily life.

## What does that look like?

Think about Newton's First Law: a body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion stays in motion. This is not only a law of physics; it's also a perfect description of procrastination and motivation. The feeling of being stuck on the couch is your own personal inertia. Building a good habit is about applying a small, consistent net force until it becomes the new state of motion. We won't just talk about feeling stuck; we'll analyze the physics of it, and we will use those same laws to get unstuck.

## Why am I starting to write this newsletter?

I’m writing this newsletter with the goal of helping fellow students and young people to develop themselves. The ultimate goal of this newsletter is to help people to become the version of themselves they always dreamed of. This is a journey I'm on myself, and I'll be sharing my process along the way such that we all get to work together toward our future successes. Also, when more people get the chance to be more positive about themselves, it often automatically translates to a positive and happy environment. Those happier and more positive environments is something that the world really needs in the present time.

I will try to achieve all of this by applying the logic, models, and different concepts of science to my day-to-day life. However, I will mainly focus on the principles of physics and astronomy because, personally, I already learned some insightful new things about my life from those two ﬁelds. A second reason why I choose to combine concepts from science with self- development is to show that science can be much more interesting than the way you learn it in school.

## What to expect from this newsletter?
In this newsletter, I’m going to write about my journey while giving advice to students and young people as well as to my younger self based on the experiences I had in the last months and years and based on the struggles and successes I will encounter in the future. You can expect to read about self-development topics like motivation, focus, habit-building, and learning, all explored through the lens of physics and astronomy. (Don’t worry, I will still be using examples from cycling to photography to stargazing.)

Every week, I will be writing a new article on a new topic or concept that could be relevant to the challenges you and I are struggling with. This new article you can always expect on a Monday in your inbox. That way, if you want to change something during the next week, you still have a whole week to read the article and to plan the changes accordingly. At least when I want to change something in my daily life, I always want to start the change with a clear, actionable plan on a Monday, at the start of a new week.

## Who is this newsletter for?

This is for you if you're a student, a young professional, or just a curious mind who wants to build a better life; not with vague platitudes, but with ﬁrst principles of science. If you'd rather understand the why behind habit-building instead of just reading another to-do list, you're in the right place.
