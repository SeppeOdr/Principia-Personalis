# Why Starting Small is the Greatest Force of the Universe

In the last article, we broke down the physics of building habits. Also, we applied those principles in our daily lives. However, if you are like me, you probably noticed that something is still off. Some of the habits are still feeling difﬁcult, or maybe even impossible, to develop or break. This is because there is an important law missing from our system. After reading this article, you will be more equipped to start building and breaking habits. But remember, you still need to apply enough force (take enough action) to get the results that you want.

## What other law is lurking behind habits?

Because I was having difﬁculties with starting to meditate for 15 minutes every day, I went back to look for principles in physics that could help me. After going through my textbooks and notes, I realized something. Newton's second law was the solution I needed to develop this habit more easily. This law of physics states that the rate at which an object accelerates is equal to the applied external force divided by the mass of that object.

In terms of habits, this means that the more habits you want to start at once (the more mass), the slower you see progress with those habits (less acceleration). Also, the more you want to do a habit from the start, the more mass you basically need to move or stop. This also results in slower progress. So, if we want to build or break habits, we need to make sure that we don't have to push too much mass at once.

## How do we make habits feel lighter?

Most people, including myself, set big goals that we want to achieve. However, when we get into the execution phase, most of the time, we want to push too much mass forward at once. This is often unsustainable for the long term and, therefore, causes us to give up. To conquer this, before we start executing our big goal, we want to break it down in tiny pieces. This gives us less mass that we have to push, so, a smaller external force will be required. Those pieces should be that small such that it almost feels impossible to not work toward our goal.

Based on Newton's second law, we should also consider how many habits we want to build or break at once. The problem people face of seeing slow progress or even no progress with their habits is often caused by too many habits. Even when each habit separately is light, the combined mass of them can be quite heavy. Again, this means that the more habits we want to change, the more external force will be required to see substantial progress with them. So, the best thing we can do is to start changing one or two habits at once instead of ten habits.

## How can we apply this principle?

If we look at the habits that I want to change, meditating for 15 minutes every day, we can immediately see that I already decided to change one habit. That's great! But the mass of this habit is still way too heavy for someone who didn't meditate for a long time. So, how do we lower the mass such that I can set myself up for success? The only thing that can still be changed is the duration. 15 minutes of mediation is not a tiny step towards my goal. It is already quite a big step. I should maybe lower it to 5 minutes. Or even only for 3 minutes. Then, when I get to this time, I can increase it every time that I feel more comfortable with meditating.

Later in my journey, when I can actually meditate for 15 minutes every day consistently, I can try to change another habit. For example, I can start walking around my neighborhood. To develop this habit, I break it again down in tiny pieces and increase it over time. This cycle can be repeated as much as you like which causes you to achieve your goals much more quickly.
