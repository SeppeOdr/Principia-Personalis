The Universe is quite empty. On Earth, air contains $\sim 10^{19}$ atoms per cubic centimeter. However, in the interstellar space, there is only $\sim 1$ atom per cubic centimeter. And n the intergalactic space, there is only $\sim 1$ atom per cubic meter. Also atoms themselves are quite empty. The distance from an atomic nucleus to an electron is $\sim 100,000$ times the size of the nucleus itself. [1]
