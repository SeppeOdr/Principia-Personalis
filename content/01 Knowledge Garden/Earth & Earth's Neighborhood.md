Earth is a nearly spherical planet with a diameter of $\sim 13,000~\text{km}$. At a distance of $\sim 384,000~\text{km}$, a natural satellite, often called the Moon, is orbiting the Earth. The Moon takes $\sim 1$ month to complete a full orbit around Earth and it has a diameter of $\sim 3,476~\text{km}$. [1]

Earth, like the 7 other planets, is orbiting a star that we call the Sun at an average distance of $\sim 150$ million kilometers or exactly $1$ astronomical unit. It takes the Earth $1$ year to go around the Sun. This means that the Earth has a speed of $\sim 110,000~\frac{\text{km}}{\text{s}}$. Besides all the 8 planets, there are also their natural satellites as well as dwarf planets that are orbiting the Sun. [1]

The Solar System itself is also moving within a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy. There are hundreds of billions of stars within this galaxy which has a diameter of $\sim 100,000~\text{ly}$. [1]

Together with more than 50 other galaxies, the Milky Way Galaxy is part of a small cluster of galaxies called the Local Group. And the Local Group is part of a supercluster of galaxies, the Virgo Supercluster, which stretches over a diameter of $\sim 110$ million light-years. [1]
