Light always travels at the same speed, the speed of light. This is the fastest possible speed in the Universe. This means that the distant objects in space can only be seen when the light of these objects had time enough to cross these large distances to Earth. [1]

To comprehend these large distances, astronomers developed a new unit called the light-year. This unit represents the distance that light travels during one year on Earth. So, because light travels $\sim 3 \cdot 10^{5}~\frac{\text{km}}{\text{s}}$, one light-year corresponds to $\sim 9.46 \cdot 10^{12}~\text{km}$. [1]

When coming back to the fact that distant objects can only be seen when the light of these objects had time enough to cross these large distances to Earth, it can also be said that when looking billions of light-years into the Universe, astronomers look billions of years in the past. The reason why only the past of these objects can be seen is that their light had only now enough time to reach Earth. [1]
