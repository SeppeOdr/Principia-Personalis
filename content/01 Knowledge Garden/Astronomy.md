Astronomy is the study of all the objects and their interactions with each other outside of our home planet Earth. Yet, astronomy is also the attempt by humans to organize all the events that happened in the Universe into a clear history. [1]

Because, in astronomy, experiments are mainly conducted by observation, it is often called an observational science. And because, in astronomy, events can only be observed after they happened, it is also often called a historical science. [1]
