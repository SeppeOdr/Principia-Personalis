# The Physics of Human Potential

Welcome. I am an undergraduate student in the **Maastricht Science Programme** at **Maastricht University** where I focus on **physics and astronomy**.

This digital garden, **Principia Personalis**, is where I document my journey to understand the fundamental laws of the universe, and how they apply to our daily lives.

## 🔭 The Observatory
Here you will find my open-source notes on the hard sciences. I publish these to help other students and to cement my own understanding.

* [[Classical Mechanics]] — The study of motion, forces, and why things stay the way they are.
* [[Relativity]] — The mind-bending revelation that space and time are not a rigid stage.
* [[Astronomy]] — Exploring the cosmos, from stars to galaxies.

## ⚛️ The Synthesis
I believe that the same laws that govern atoms also govern our habits. Here I explore the connection between physics and self-development.

* [[002 Newton's First Law in Disguise]] — Why starting a new habit is the hardest part.
* [[003 Formula for Habits]] — Why starting small is the greatest force of the universe.
* [[004 Action-Reaction Principle]] — Why your environment pushes you back.

## 📩 Principia Personalis
*The Newsletter*

While this website houses my **knowledge** (the "What"), my newsletter houses the **application** (the "How").

Join me on **Substack** where I write weekly essays on applying the wisdom of physics to build a better life and career.
